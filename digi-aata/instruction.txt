DIGI-AATA STATIC E-COMMERCE MVP INSTRUCTIONS (Ready-to-feed to an LLM)
===============================================================================
Goal:
A static, production-ready React + TypeScript (Vite) project that LOOKS / FEELS like
an e-commerce site but uses hardcoded product data (from the attached PDF). No
payment integration or dynamic product management. Full cart flow, checkout form,
local persistence, responsive layout, and brochure-inspired visual style.

Use this file as a single prompt/input to an LLM-based code generator (or paste
into your own implementation). It contains all functional requirements, data,
design tokens, sample product data, folder layout, dev commands, acceptance tests,
and implementation notes.

-------------------------
1) PROJECT SUMMARY (MVP)
-------------------------
- Name: digi-aata-demo
- Type: static SPA (Single Page App) built with Vite + React + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (preferred). Optionally CSS Modules if you do not want Tailwind.
- Router: react-router-dom
- State: React Context for cart; cart persisted to localStorage
- Purpose: Showcase products (hard-coded JSON) with full add-to-cart and checkout
  experience (no payment). Must be easily replaceable by a real backend later.

-------------------------
8) FUNCTIONAL SPEC & CONTRACTS
-------------------------
CartContext API:
  addToCart(productId: string, qty: number): void
  removeFromCart(productId: string): void
  updateQty(productId: string, qty: number): void
  clearCart(): void
  getCart(): { items: {productId, qty}[], total: number }

LocalStorage keys:
  'cart' -> JSON { items: [ { id, qty } ], lastUpdated: timestamp }
  'orders' -> JSON array of placed orders

Checkout flow:
  - Validate required fields (name, phone)
  - On Place Order:
      orders = localStorage.getItem('orders') || []
      create order object { id: uuid(), items: cart.items, total, customer: {...}, createdAt }
      push to orders, save back to localStorage
      clear cart
      show Order Success page with order summary and printable order id

ProductPage route:
  /product/:id  (use react-router params to read id -> fetch from products.ts)

Search & Filters (optional, MVP minimal):
  - Simple client-side search by name and shortDescription
  - Filter by price ranges or age (optional)

-------------------------
9) ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (TESTABLE)
-------------------------
Functional:
  - Adding same product increments qty; cart count updates
  - Removing product updates count and total
  - Cart persists after full page reload
  - Checkout form validates and creates an order in localStorage
  - Product detail page shows correct product by id

Design:
  - Colors match design tokens and background is warm beige
  - Responsive product grid (3/2/1 columns)
  - Header cart badge shows integer count

Accessibility:
  - All buttons reachable by keyboard, images have alt text, form fields have labels

Testing:
  - Add unit tests that assert CartContext.addToCart and persistence behavior

-------------------------
10) README (copy-paste)
-------------------------
# digi-aata-demo
Static React + TypeScript demo e-commerce site with hardcoded products (no payments).

## Setup
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Build
npm run build
npm run preview

## Tests
npm test

## Notes
- Products are in src/data/products.ts
- Cart stored in localStorage under 'cart'
- Orders stored in localStorage under 'orders'

-------------------------
11) EXTRA IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (LLM-specific)
-------------------------
- When prompting an LLM to generate the repo, ask it to output file tree and then file contents in code blocks with file paths as headings, e.g.:
  ``` 
  /src/main.tsx
  ``` 
  then code block.

- Ask the LLM to generate sample images placeholder files (or tiny base64 placeholder PNGs) if real images are unavailable.

- Ensure any generated code uses TypeScript types and exports for Product, CartItem, Order.

- Prefer small, well-commented components for maintainability. Keep styling in Tailwind utility classes, but centralize color tokens in tailwind.config.js (theme.extend.colors) OR in :root CSS variables.

-------------------------
12) SEO, Analytics & Contact Hooks (optional)
-------------------------
- Add meta tags for description, title, og:image (use brochure hero)
- Add an invisible contact form submit to send customer details via email (external service) later; for now, log to console and save to localStorage.
- Placeholder for Google Analytics or Plausible (add ID in environment variable)

-------------------------
13) SECURITY & PRIVACY
-------------------------
- No payments or customer data sent to third parties in MVP
- If later integrating analytics or email, disclose in privacy policy
- Store only minimal customer info and delete older orders on a schedule (manual step)

-------------------------
14) DELIVERY (what LLM should output)
-------------------------
- Complete ready-to-run repo file list (package.json, vite.config, tailwind.config, tsconfig.json)
- /src/data/products.ts (complete)
- Components, pages, context, hooks, styles
- README with setup & run instructions
- Unit tests for CartContext
- A produced archive or instructions to create the project locally
